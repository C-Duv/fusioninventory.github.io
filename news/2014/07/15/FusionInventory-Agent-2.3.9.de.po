"This release improves printer consumables identification during network "
"inventory, and adds support for Huawei devices identification (H3C devices "
"were added in 2.3.8). It also externalize the knowledge used for such "
"recognition from the perl code into static data files, to allow easier "
"update without updating the agent itself. Multiple minor local inventory "
"issues were also fixed, mainly for Windows platform. One of those issue "
"involves a behaviour change: user-installed softwares won't be inventoried "
"by defaut anymore, unless scan-user-profile configuration option is used, as "
"it could result in user profile corruption (#2555)."
