"<strong>Pull</strong>: The agent takes the initiative to contact the "
"server. The server answer with the list of all tasks assigned to the "
"agent. This is very useful in an environment where the presence of the "
"agents is not predictable. The server is waiting for agents requests and "
"can't force the precise schedule of a task."

"<strong>Push</strong> : The server takes the initiative to contact the "
"agent. The agent, running as a service, is waiting for the order from the "
"server. When waking up, the agent contacts the server. The server answer "
"with the list of all tasks assigned to the agent."

"<strong> </strong></li>* <strong>Schedule</strong> : The task's execution "
"can be scheduled. For tasks using push communication, the starting time is "
"the effective startup time of the action. For tasks using pull "
"communication, the starting time defines the time where the server will "
"begin to distribute the task to the agents.\n"
"* <strong>Agent selection</strong>: You can choose which agents have to "
"perform a   task, or let FusionInventory for GLPI dynamically manage a "
"dynamic pool   of agents.\n"
"* <strong>Tasks and Actions</strong> : A task can contain an unlimited "
"number of actions. For example a first action will wake up a computer (Wake "
"On LAN) and a second one will perform an inventory.\n"

"<strong>Dynamic pool of agents</strong>: When using the Push mode, the "
"server looks for all agents running and allowed to run a specific module "
"(inventory, netdiscovery, snmpinventory, wakeonlan). The server then balance "
"the load of the process within the agents. For example if you use an IP "
"range with 10 agents, each agent will have to do 1/10 of the whole job."
