"FusionInventory 2.3.2 for GLPI is compatible with GLPI 0.78.x. Version 2.4.0 "
"is on the way, bringing compatibility with GLPI 0.80 (which is currently "
"available as RC2). It'll bring new features, such as virtualization and "
"remote Vmware ESX/ESXi/vCenter inventory.  At the same time, work on "
"usability and documentation is being made, to facilitate and daily use of "
"the plugins.  The agent is being rewritten, and communication protocol is "
"switching from XML to REST/JSON. Finally, later this year, the project "
"should release a brand new software deployment module and an agent for "
"Android phones and tablets."
