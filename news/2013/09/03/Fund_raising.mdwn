FusionInventory.org website is hosted by <http://www.Branchable.com>. 
They offer [Ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info/) hosting for a reasonable price
and support FreeSoftware (Debian, git-annex, Ikiwiki, Obnam, etc).

2 years ago the [Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/) decided to pay the
bill for 24 months. Again, we want to thank them!

Now the last dollar has been spent and we are looking for people interested in supporting us
financially.

The best would be at least $59.99, to get a one year support. Please [contact us if
you are interested](mailto:goneri@lebouder.net)!

## UPDATE

The people from [Normation](http://www.normation.com/) paid the hosting till 2017 !!!

[Normation](http://www.normation.com/) is the software company behind the open source project
[Rudder](http://www.normation.com/solutions/rudder>), a turn-key solution that helps
enterprises gain control over their IT infrastructure through automation and
continuous configuration assessment. Normation also acts as a solution
provider, making available the teamâ€™s leading expertise in open source
technology and *infrastructure orchestration* as a range of services
including consulting, training and professional support.

Thank you guys!
