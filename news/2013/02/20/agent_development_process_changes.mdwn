Hello all,

Following a meeting between the agent developers, the development process of the
agent has been changed a bit. Here are the gory details.

## branches management

"master" will be the stable branch with some validated new feature. New feature
will be prepared in "master+feature" branch and merged as soon as the feature
is validated by the team.

For example, to develop a new feature:

1. a new development branch called master+feature\_name is created
2. the new feature is added, with adequate unit tests
3. the new feature is validated
4. the development branch get merged in the master branch

The "master" branch must will be released regulary and has to be stable.

Stable branch will be created when needed, (e.g, 2.3.x) to prepare bug fixes
releases.

## branches renaming

* "2.3.x" is now "master"
* "master" is now "master+restjson"
* "2.3.x+foo" are now "master+foo"

Some old branches have been renamed with a new "attic/" prefix.

## Additional tasks integration

Additional agent tasks (network discovery, network inventory, ESX inventory and
software deployement) developed and distributed separatly will be integrated
into the agent repository, and the corresponding forge projects will be closed.

## 2.3.0 release

The 2.3.0 release is mostly ready. We have to work on the Windows installer to
finish what Tom√°s Abad started some weeks ago.
