Hello all,

Following a meeting between the agent developers, the release process of the
agent has been changed a bit. We will follow a Linux like development process:

## development process branches

"master" will be the stable branch with some validated new feature. New feature
will be prepared in "master+feature" branch and merged as soon as the feature
is validated by the team.

For example, I want a new feature:

1. The developer create a branch called master+feature\_name
2. The developer adds the feature and refresh the test-suite
3. The new feature is validation
4. The branch get merged in the master branch

The "master" branch must will be released regulary and has to be stable.

Stable branch will be created when needed, (e.g, 2.3.x) to prepare bug fixes
releases.

## branches renamed

* "2.3.x" is now "master"
* "master" is now "master+restjson"
* "2.3.x+foo" are now "master+foo"

Some old branches have been renamed with a new "attic/" prefix.

## Agent::Task merge

Agent::Task::Network, Agent::Task::ESX and Agent::Task::Deploy will be merged
within the Agent repository. The associated projects on the forge will be
merged too.

## 2.3.0 release

The 2.3.0 release is mostly ready. We have to work on the Windows installer to
finish what Tom√°s Abad started some weeks ago.
