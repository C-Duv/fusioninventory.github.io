"The latest 2.3.3 version, released yesterday, provides a new features for "

"As described [[here|/documentation/fi4g/networkdiscovery/]], network "
"discovery is actually a two-stage process: devices have to be found first, "
"identified second. Identification here means determining a few minimal "
"information about the discovered device (its type, manufacturer, etc), with "
"two purposes:"

"to affect it an SNMP description model, so as to be able to run a network "
"inventory task later on the device (currently, no SNMP model means no "
"inventory)"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"So far, this identification process relied merely on the device SysDescr "
"value, as it is a standard and universal SNMP value, identificating the "
"underlying device as a free-text string. For instance, \"Lexmark C935 "
"version NC.NPS.N129S1 kernel 2.6.10 All-N-1\" correspond to a specific "
"Lexmark printer, with a specific firmware level."

"The specificity of this string offers the advantage of allowing to identify "
"both hardware and firmware at once, but is also quite fragile: a single "
"firmware update, and it changes. As current agent identification process "
"relies on exact matching, a simple character changes, and the identification "
"fails.  Totally. Meaning no SNMP model affected. Meaning no network "
"inventory..."

"This process could of course be made a bit more robust, by allowing fuzzy "
"matching, using regular expressions for instance. However, we'd still rely "
"on manually collecting sysdescr values, and associating them with known "
"hardware and firmware versions, which is quite inefficient."

#. type: Plain text

"The agent now relies on another standard SNMP value, the SysObjectID value.  "
"This is value is actually an OID (object identifier), using IANA-normalized "
"value for identificating manufacturer, and a manufacturer-specific value for "
"identificating device model. For instance, \".1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.516\" "
"identifies a Cisco Catalyst 3750-24/48 device. It doesn't allow to identify "
"firmware level, tough, meaning it can't completly replace SysDescr usage so "
"far, as we need to know the exact firmware for inventory. However, it is "
"stable, meaning firmware update won't prevent device identification anymore. "
"And they are exhaustive list of values available, as most manufacturer "
"publish them. Meaning we're no longer dependant of the \"we can only "
"recognize what we already seen somewhere\" syndrom."

"The result of this change is than, starting with agent version 2.3.3, a "
"successful discovery result is now pushed to the server as \"there is a "
"Cisco Catalyst 3750-24/48 device at IP address w.x.y.z\", instead of \"there "
"is an unknown Cisco device at IP address w.x.y.z, use network inventory to "
"find what it is later\". Unfortunatly, the GLPI server doesn't handle this "
"additional information (at this stage) yet, meaning there is no immediate "
"advantage.  That's a first step, but a robust step, toward general "
"improvement of the whole network discovery and inventory functionality of "
"FusionInventory."
