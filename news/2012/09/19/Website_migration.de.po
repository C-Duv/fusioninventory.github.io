"A few years ago, we decided to use [DITA "
"XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture) "
"for documentation and [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) for the "
"Website. DITA is too complicated for us without major advantages (tool "
"chain, hard to translate, require an XML editor).  Wordpress is a great "
"product, but we only used it to publish static page from time to time."
