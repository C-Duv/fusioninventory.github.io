"A large part of the FusionInventory team has made the move at "
"[FrOSCAmp](http://froscamp.org) in Zurich, Switzerland, thanks to Mathieu "
"Simon who organized our venue and is a wonderful local support. We could "
"present the project new features, now that the [agent version "
"2.1](fusioninventory-agent-2-1) and the [plugin for GLPI version "
"2.2.2](fusioninventory-for-glpi-plugin-in-2-2-2) have been released. The "
"conference and the booth were places to start lots of discussions. For the "
"team, time to meet for the first time in real life the new contributors. The "
"roadmap for the next version of the agent has been fixed : the efforts on "
"[version 2.2](http://forge.fusioninventory.org/versions/show/2) will be "
"focused on performance and security improvements.  [gallery columns=\"3\"]"
