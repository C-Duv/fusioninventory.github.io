"There was a talk about Fusioninventory at Linux Open Administration Days "
"(LOADAYS) in Antwerpen (Belgium), on 11/04/2020. Fabrice explained origins "
"of the project, what it's currently possible to do with the agent and the "
"associated tools, how to get the software, and why you should use the "
"fusioninventory agent. You can find here the [slides of the "
"talk](/news/2010/04/11/fusioninventory-at-loadays-2010.pdf). The room was "
"full and we had a lot of interesting questions from the audience. Apart from "
"this, Loadays was awesome, with a lot of presentations and side talks about "
"configuration management databases, massive deployment. A great event for "
"system administrators and devops!"
