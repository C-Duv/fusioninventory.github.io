"We also decide to migrate the Bzr repositories to Git for various "
"reasons. Bzr repository format uses to be changed in a incompatible way by "

"export/import in Git/Hg format without a mapping file. Because of that It's "
"very hard to work with Mercurial or Git on a Bzr repository."

"Now our repositories are in Git format, depending on what people needs, we "
"can provide public Gateway to Mercurial or Bzr. Even svn through Github! "
