"We now provide an unique agent running on multiple OSes like Windows, MacOS "
"X, Linux, *BSD, HP-UX. This agent is modular and already can perform "
"serveral tasks like local inventory of computers, network inventory with "
"SNMP, network discovery, remote wake up of computers, remote wake up of the "
"agent, deployment of packages using OCSNG methods. And as the "
"FusionInventory agent is modular, everybody can add his own task. On the "
"server side, a generic library is also on the way to communicate with the "
"agents. This library will be the core of an integration into GLPI.\n"
