Last week, FusionInventory.org website has been migrated from
[Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.com) to [Ikiwiki](http://www.ikiwiki.info).

## Why

Some years ago, we decided to use DITA XML for documentation and
[Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) for the Website. DITA is to complex for us
without major benefit (tool chain, hard to translate, require an XML editor for most of
the humain).
Wordpress is a great product, but we were using it only to publish static page time to
time.

## Ikiwiki

So we decide to change the situation to be able to provide an up to date [[documentation]]
directly on the website. For this, we are very happy with Ikiwiki:

* We can maintain the documentation directly with Git and a text editor
* Anyone can update documentation/* pages from the Web without any special account
* The [[Markdown syntax|ikiwiki/formatting]] is simple enough
* Tools like [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) exist to convert or generate Markdown
from different formats (HTML, ODT, DOC, etc).

## We are looking for people willing to help us for the documentation_

* You did a tutorial for your company and want to share it.
* You want to fix some issues with the current documentation.
* You are a translator?
