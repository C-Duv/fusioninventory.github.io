# Push my inventories in the server

## fusioninventory-injector

    fusioninventory-injector -v -f myfile.xml -u http://glpi083/plugins/fusioninventory/

## curl

You can also use curl to push an inventory. This can be useful for example if your perl installation has no SSL support and so you can not use the fusioninventory-injector command with a HTTPS only server:

    curl --header "Content-Type: Application/x-compress" --cacert your-ca.pem -u username:password --data @/tmp/lazer.local-2011-10-04-12-21-23.ocs https://glpi/plugins/fusioninventory/

With no SSL check  and no authentification :

    curl --header "Content-Type: Application/x-compress" -k --data @/tmp/monposte.local-2012-10-04-12-21-23.ocs https://myglpiserver/plugins/fusioninventory/

## HTTP Proxy

If you want to use a HTTP proxy, you can declare it with the http_proxy environment variable:

    export http_proxy=http://myproxy:3128
