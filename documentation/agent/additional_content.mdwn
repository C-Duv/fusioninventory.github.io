# How to push additional content in my inventory

## --additional-content

You can ask your agent to inject additional content during the inventory
creation:

    # cat /tmp/foo.xml 
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
    <REQUEST>
      <CONTENT>
          <SOFTWARES>
              <NAME>foo</NAME>
              <VERSION>bar</VERSION>
          </SOFTWARES>
      </CONTENT>
    </REQUEST> 
    # fusioninventory-agent --additional-content /tmp/foo.xml

`additional-content` can also be a registry key.

## Your own Perl module

You can extend FusionInventory by creating your own collect module in
'lib/FusionInventory/Agent/Task/Inventory/Input/Generic/Softwares/'.

The module will be automaticly loaded at run time.
