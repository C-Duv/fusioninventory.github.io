"First, the server automatically trust any received message, using the "
"identifier found in the message (unfortunatly called DEVICEID) to identify "
"the sending agent. If you want to protect your machine inventory from rogue "
"reports, you have to restrict access to the plugin location on your GLPI "
"server, typically using HTTP authentication. And preferentially over HTTPS, "
"to prevent password sniffing."

#. type: Plain text

"Second, some messages between the server and the agent may contain sensible "
"informations. For instance, NetInventory tasks involves sending SNMP "
"credentials from the server to the agent. In this case, HTTPS usage ensures "
"proper communication encryption."

#. type: Plain text

"Third, some tasks are explicitely designed to make the agent execute "
"arbitrary commands on its host. For instance, the Deploy task is used to "
"install software on agent side. In this case, HTTPS usage ensures proper "
"server authentication."

"LWP (also known as libwww-perl) is able to use either Crypt::SSLeay or "
"IO::Socket::SSL transparently as underlying socket implementation for HTTPS "
"support. However, only the second one is able to perform server certificate "
"validation. As a consequence, the agent will refuse to use HTTPS, and exit "
"immediatly if IO::Socket::SSL is not available, unless certificate checking "
"has been explicitely disabled (--no-ssl-check command line parameter, or "
"no-ssl-check configuration parameter)."

"The SSL protocol version supported by the agent is dependant of openssl "
"version. In particular, usage of specific certificate signature algorithms "
"such as SHA requires at least openssl 0.9.8o, as it is supposed to be "
"allowed starting from TLS 1.1 only. Failure to comply will result in error "
