# How to report issues efficiently

In order for the developers to track and fix issues properly, you need to use the forge bug tracker (<http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-agent/issues>). A account is required.

# Best practice

Here are a few usage rules, so as to avoid wasting efforts both for the reporters and for the assignees.

## Get a full log

You can increase the agent verbosity if you:

* add debug=2 in agent.cfg or set the debug key to 2 in the Windows registry. You will need to restart the daemon or service after that.
* call fusioninventory-agent with 2 `--debug` parameters: `fusioninventory-agent --debug --debug`

## Bug priority and category

It is useless to set a priority, it will be re-evaluated by the assignee anyway.

However, you have to identify is your problem is an agent or a server issue. If you don't, that will be the first question anyway.

The easiest way to make the distinction is to look at the raw XML content sent by the agent, available in GLPI. You can also force a local agent execution, with either `--stdout` or `--local` /any/where flags, and look at the resulting content. If the information is missing or erroneous in the agent output, that's an agent issue. If the information is present, but not visible from the server, that's a server issue.

## Problem description

You have to use english, for sake of internationalization.

You have to describe your problem clearly and precisely, for someone without any prior knowledge of your environment to understand it. Posting screenshot is not a solution if you're unable to explain it with words.

Also, the agent is available for different platforms, with different versions, and different installation methods. You have to specify at least the system you're using, and the agent version.

You can get the versions of the agent and its sub-tasks with these commands:

* `fusioninventory-agent --version`
* `fusioninventory-agent --list-tasks`

## Problem reproductability

That's quite useless to report a problem, if there is no way for the assignee to reproduce it.

If the problem is related to an erroneous analysis of some system input, the best way is to provide a sample of the information, and the related excerpt of agent output. Identifying the exact system input is usually quite easy to do from reading the agent code.

## Providing additional content

If you need to provide additional command output samples, here are a few important rules:

* always attach external files, rather than pasting content, as some invisible formating can be lost
* always run command under non-localized environment (`LC_ALL=C` under unix systems)
* windows WMI queries can be exported with `wmic` tool
* windows registry content can be exported with regedit tool
