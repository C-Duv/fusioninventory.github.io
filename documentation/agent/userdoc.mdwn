# Configuration

How to configure the agent

The agent settings are based on a classic key/value mechanism.

* Windows: with the registry keys located at KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/FusionInventory-Agent
* MacOSX: the configuration file is located in /opt/fusionInventory-agent/agent.cfg
* UNIX/Linux: on UNIX/Linux, the agent expect its configuration to be here /etc/fusioninventory/agent.cfg
* prebuilt: if you use a prebuilt package, the agent.cfg configuration is in the packages&apos; root directory.
