# Agent Installation on Linux

A FusionInventory agent package is available for various specific Linux
distributions. However, for various constraints (maintainer availability,
distribution freeze, etc...), they are not always up-to-date.

Installation from source, though, ensures to have the latest release, and is
quite easy to achieve through a CPAN client.
