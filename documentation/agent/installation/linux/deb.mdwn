# Using FusionInventory debian packages

Installation with the debian packages

Some distributions like Debian do already have versions of the FusionInventory agent  in their distribution repositories. We recommend to use this option if you only need inventory.

## FusionInventory Agent is also available in Debian Backports repository

    echo "deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports squeeze-backports main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -t squeeze-backports fusioninventory-agent

## FusionInventory own repository

[[!template  id=warning text="The internal repository will be remove in the coming month."]]

The FusionInventory project maintains an up-to-date debian package of the most recent version, in a extra repository.

    echo "deb http://debian.fusioninventory.org/debian/ stable main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
    wget -O - http://debian.fusioninventory.org/debian/archive.key | sudo apt-key add -
    apt-get update
    apt-get install fusioninventory-agent

If you use https to contact your server, you will need to install Crypt::SSLeay:

    apt-get install libcrypt-ssleay-perl
