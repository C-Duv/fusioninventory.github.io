## Using Mac OS X Installer


Installation of the agent with the Mac OS X installer

The FusionInventory project provides 2 Mac OS X packages: one for powerpc computers and the other for Intel macs.

The package is a .pkg file, and is designed for silent installation. Agent&apos;s configuration needs to be done before install, by going into the package, and edit the Content\Resources\agent.cfg file.

By default, the agent runs as a daemon, and stores his files in /opt/fusioninventory-agent.

Please note that FusionInventory agent is not a Mac OS X application, and his invisible for users.

Once configured, the agent can be deployed either manually (by double clicking on the .pkg file), nor automatically using tools like Apple Remote Desktop.
