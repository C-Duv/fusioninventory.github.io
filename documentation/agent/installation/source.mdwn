# Installation from the source tarball

## agent from sources

We strongly recommand the use of __GNU tar__ because some file path lenght are greater
than 100 caracters. Some tar version will silently ignore those files like for example
HP-UX.


First, you need to extract the source and run the Makefile.PL

    tar xfz FusionInventory-Agent-2.2.5.tar.gz
    cd FusionInventory-Agent-2.2.5
    perl Makefile.PL

Makefile.PL will ensure all the required dependencies are available and
prepare the build tree.

At this point, you will probably have some missing required modules. The best tool
to resolve the situation is cpanm. Just run:

    cpanm .

You can use the _--notest_ flag if you are brave and want to skip the test-suite
execution.

Once this is done, run once again:

    perl Makefile.Pl

This time the execution should success and you can finish the installation

    make test
    make install

## plugins installation from source

The plugin installation follow the same process:

    tar xfz FusionInventory-Agent-Task-Foo-0.1.2.tar.gz
    cd FusionInventory-Agent-Task-Foo-0.1.2
    cpanm .
    perl Makefile.PL
    make test
    make install

# SSL

SSL communication are based on IO::Socket::SSL. You build it you will need
openssl header files. Those files are in general in /usr/include/openssl/.

If you don't want to use SSL, you can avoid keep this dependency uninstalled.
The agent will disable SSL by itself.
