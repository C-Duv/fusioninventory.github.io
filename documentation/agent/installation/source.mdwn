# Installation from the source tarball

## Get the sources Luke!

You can download the last tarball archive from [the forge](http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-agent/files)
or directly from [the CPAN](https://metacpan.org/release/FusionInventory-Agent).

Tarball with a **rc** or **beta** version suffix are developpement release not ready
for production.

## agent from sources

We strongly recommand the use of __GNU tar__ because some file path lenght are greater
than 100 caracters. Some tar version will silently ignore those files like for example
on HP-UX.

First, you need to extract the source and run the Makefile.PL

    tar xfz FusionInventory-Agent-2.2.5.tar.gz
    cd FusionInventory-Agent-2.2.5

Makefile.PL will ensure all the required dependencies are available and
prepare the build tree.

    perl Makefile.PL

At this point, you will probably have some missing required modules. The best tool
to resolve the situation is [cpanm](https://raw.github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus/master/cpanm). Just run:

    cpanm .

You can use the _--notest_ flag if you are brave and want to skip the test-suite
execution.

You may also need to install some [[system specific dependencies|documentation/agent/system_dep]].

Once this is done, run once again:

    perl Makefile.Pl

This time the execution should success and you can finish the installation. Here again
we recommand GNU make (gmake):

    make
    make test
    make install

## Change the installation directory

If you don't want to use the default directory (/usr/local), you can use the PREFIX
parameter during the Makefile.PL step:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/opt/fusioninventory
    make
    make test
    make install

## plugins installation from source

The plugin installation follow the same process:

    tar xfz FusionInventory-Agent-Task-Foo-0.1.2.tar.gz
    cd FusionInventory-Agent-Task-Foo-0.1.2
    cpanm .
    perl Makefile.PL
    make test
    make install

# configuration

Agent will read it's configuration from /etc/fusioninventory/agent.cfg. You need at least a `server` line:

    server = http://server.domain.com/glpi/plugins/fusioninventory/

# crontab

You can use the [crontab](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to launch the agent. The agent will need a correctly initialized $PATH environment variable.

This is an example of an /etc/crontab entry:

    PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
    17 *    * * *   root   fusioninventory-agent

# SSL

SSL communication are based on IO::Socket::SSL. You build it you will need
openssl header files and a C compiler.

If you don't want to use SSL, you can avoid keep this dependency uninstalled.
The agent will disable SSL by itself.
