# Installation from the source tarball

## Get the sources Luke!

The latest relase is available either from [our forge](http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-agent/files) or from [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/release/FusionInventory-Agent).

It is also possible to retrieve a snapshot from Github:

* [Agent 2.2.x](https://github.com/fusinv/fusioninventory-agent/tarball/2.2.x)
* [Agent 2.3.x](https://github.com/fusinv/fusioninventory-agent/tarball/2.3.x)

## agent from sources

We strongly recommand the use of __GNU tar__ because some file path lenght are greater
than 100 caracters. Some tar version will silently ignore those files like for example
on HP-UX.

First, you need to extract the source and run the Makefile.PL

    tar xfz FusionInventory-Agent-2.2.5.tar.gz
    cd FusionInventory-Agent-2.2.5

Makefile.PL will ensure all the required dependencies are available and
prepare the build tree.

    perl Makefile.PL

At this point, you will probably have some missing required modules. The best tool
to resolve the situation is [cpanm](https://raw.github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus/master/cpanm). Just run:

    cpanm .

You can use the _--notest_ flag if you are brave and want to skip the test-suite
execution.

You may also need to install some [[system specific dependencies|documentation/agent/system_dep]].

Once this is done, run once again:

    perl Makefile.Pl

This time the execution should success and you can finish the installation. Here again
we recommand GNU make (gmake):

    make
    make install

## Change the installation directory

If you don't want to use the default directory (/usr/local), you can use the PREFIX
parameter during the Makefile.PL step:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/opt/fusioninventory
    make
    make test
    make install

## plugins installation from source

The plugin installation follow the same process:

    tar xfz FusionInventory-Agent-Task-Foo-0.1.2.tar.gz
    cd FusionInventory-Agent-Task-Foo-0.1.2
    cpanm .
    perl Makefile.PL
    make install

# SSL

SSL communication are based on [IO::Socket::SSL](https://metacpan.org/module/IO::Socket::SSL). You build it you will need
openssl header files and a C compiler.

If you don't want to use SSL, you can avoid keep this dependency uninstalled.
The agent will disable SSL by itself.

# Test-suite

FusionInventory components come with a test-suite. You can run it after the `perl Makefile.PL` with this command:

    make test

The test-suites require some additional dependencies like Test::More.

# How to fetch the dependencies with no Internet connection

    $ tar xfz FusionInventory-Agent-2.3.0.tar.gz
    $ cd FusionInventory-Agent-2.3.0
    $ cpanm --pureperl --installdeps -L extlib --notest .

This command should fail with an error regarding Params::Validate. Just runs this last
command:

    $cpanm --installdeps -L extlib --notest .

Now you can copy the directory to another machine and run the agent this way:

    $ perl -Iextlib/lib/perl5 -Ilib fusioninventory-agent


[[!template  id=info text="SSL will work only if the perl SSL lib is already installed on the system. Se
above"]]
