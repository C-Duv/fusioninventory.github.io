# Microsoft Windows Installation

[[!template id=warning text="The new FusionInventory Agent 2.3.x comes with a **new** Microsoft Windows installer. The documentation you have below is regarding this new installer. If you are looking for documentation about FusionInventory Agent 2.2.x (and previous) and its installer, you find it [[here|documentation/agent/installation/windows_before_2.3.0]]."]]



## Get the Installer



You can get the last FusionInventory Agent installer for Microsoft Windows [here](http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-agent-windows-installer/files "http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-agent-windows-installer/files"). The file name of the installer follows this pattern:



    fusioninventory-agent_windows-<platform>_<version>.exe
                                       |         |
                                       v         |
                                                 |
                                 'x86' | 'x64'   |
                                                 v
                                                  
                     <mayor>.<minor>.<release>[-<package>]



Some notes about the new FusionInventory Agent installer for Microsoft Windows.



* The installer for each *\<platform>*, integrates its native, although reduced, version of [Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/ "http://strawberryperl.com/") 5.16.3.1.



* Inside the *\<version>*, *\<package>* is optional and indicates the secuence of the installer for FusionInventory Agent *\<manor>*.*\<minor>*.*\<release>*. A new *\<package>* may contain improvements regarding the installer itself, the agent (patches) or both.



* It's possible to install *fusioninventory-agent_windows_x86_\<version>.exe* on a 32-bit or 64-bit Microsoft Windows system but only is possible to install *fusioninventory-agent_windows_x64_\<version>.exe* on a 64-bit Microsoft Windows system.



## The Installer Manual



You can find the manual of the FusionInventory Agent installer for Microsoft Windows [[here|documentation/agent/installation/windows/windows-installer-2.3.x-command-line]].



The manual is self-contained in the own installer. You can get it of one of the following ways:



*         C:\> fusioninventory-agent_windows-<platform>_<version>.exe /help



*         C:\> fusioninventory-agent_windows-<platform>_<version>.exe /dumphelp



*         C:\> fusioninventory-agent_windows-<platform>_<version>.exe /dumphelp /S



[[!template id=info text="It's recommended read this documentation completely each time a new version is released; the new FusionInventory Agent installer for Microsoft Windows is still young and it's in a constant process of improvement, including its manual."]]



## Installation from Command Line and Silent Installation



The FusionInventory Agent installer for Microsoft Windows performs a *visual mode* installation unless it's specified the ***/S*** option in the command line, in whose case it performs a *silent mode* installation.



For more information about the use of the command line, please, see ***The Installer Manual*** section above.



## Visual Installation



As it said above, unless it's specified the ***/S*** option in the command line, the FusionInventory Agent installer for Microsoft Windows performs a *visual mode* installation. The easy way of performs a *visual mode* installation is doing double click on the *fusioninventory-agent_windows-\<platform>_\<version>.exe* program.



The fields and controls that appear in the *visual mode* installation are intimately related with the command line options. That's the reason because it's recommended to read ***The Installer Manual*** section (*see above*) before to perform any installation.



For more information about the *visual mode* installation, please, see the following gallery of commented [[screenshots of FusionInventory Agent installer for Microsoft Windows|documentation/agent/installation/windows/windows-installer-2.3.x-visual-mode]]. (*still under construction*)



## Large Installations



A page is dedicated to explain how to [[deploy FusionInventory Agent 2.2.x (and previous) on a Windows Domain|documentation/agent/installation/windows/large_install]] but, at the moment, those instructions are invalid for the new FusionInventory Agent installer.



Nowadays, and while the new page is written with more detail about its use, it's available from here the new VBScript (Visual Basic Script) with name *fusioninventory-agent-deployment.vbs* that allows to perform an unattended deployment of *fusioninventory-agent_windows-\<platform>_\<version>.exe* in large (and in not so large) environments. You can find its last version [[here|https://raw.github.com/fusinv/fusioninventory-agent/2.3.x/contrib/windows/fusioninventory-agent-deployment.vbs]].



## Installation from Sources



If you are a developer, or an advanced user, you can also install FusionInventory Agent 2.3.x [[from sources|documentation/agent/dev/git_windows]].
