## Get the Installer



You can get the last FusionInventory Agent installer for Microsoft Windows [here](http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-agent-windows-installer/files "http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-agent-windows-installer/files"). The file name of the installer follows this pattern:



    fusioninventory-agent_windows-<platform>_<version>.exe  
                                       |         |
                                       v         |
                                                 |
                                 'x86' | 'x64'   |
                                                 v
                                                  
                     <mayor>.<minor>.<release>[-<package>]



Some notes about the new FusionInventory Agent Installer for Microsoft Windows.



* The installer for each *\<platform>*, integrates its native, although reduced, version of [Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/ "http://strawberryperl.com/") 5.16.3.1.



* Inside the *\<version>*, *\<package>* is optional and indicates the secuence of the installer for FusionInventory Agent *\<manor>*.*\<minor>*.*\<release>*. A new *\<package>* may contain improvements regarding the installer itself, the agent (patches) or both.



* It's possible to install *fusioninventory-agent_windows_x86_2.3.x.exe* on a 32-bit or 64-bit Microsoft Windows system but only is possible to install *fusioninventory-agent_windows_x64_2.3.x.exe* on a 64-bit Microsoft Windows system.



## The Installer Manual



You can find the manual of the new FusionInventory Agent Installer for Microsoft Windows [[here|documentation/agent/installation/windows/windows-installer-2.3.x-command-line]].



The manual is self-contained in the own installer. You can get it of one of the following ways:



*         C:\> fusioninventory-agent_windows-<platform>_<version>.exe /help



*         C:\> fusioninventory-agent_windows-<platform>_<version>.exe /dumphelp



*         C:\> fusioninventory-agent_windows-<platform>_<version>.exe /dumphelp /S



[[!template id=info text="It's recommended read this documentation completely each time a new version is released; the new FusionInventory Agent Installer for Microsoft Windows is still young and it is in a constant process of improvement, including its manual."]]



## Large Installations



A page is dedicated to explain how to [[deploy FusionInventory Agent 2.2.x (and previous) on a Windows Domain|documentation/agent/installation/windows/large_install]] but, at the moment, those instructions are invalid for the new FusionInventory Agent installer.



## Installation from Sources



If you are a developer, or an advanced user, you can also install FusionInventory Agent 2.3.x [[from sources|documentation/agent/dev/git_windows]].
