# Windows installation

## Get the installer

First, download the archive: <http://prebuilt.fusioninventory.org/stable/windows-i386/>

The file name convention is:

* fusioninventory-agent_windows-i386_
* FusionInventory Agent version (e.g: 2.2.5)
* a *-* (dash)
* the package revision. e.g: 2, for the 2nd installer generated for the 2.2.5 release
* .exe

The installer can be used either on 32 or 64 bit Windows.

## Installer command line parameters

* /help   Display this help. The space in front of /help is mandatory!
* /S      Run setup in silent mode
* /installdir=dirname     Set installation directory of agent
* /server=url1,url2       Set url of server
* /tag=tagame     Set tag of agent
* /user=username  Set username

* /runnow         Run agent after end of installation
* /update-firewall        Update the Firewall to register the agent
* /execmode=option        launch the agent with a service(service)/windows task scheduler(task)/or keep settings unchanged(none) (default is service)

## Usage

To pass the parameters, do for example:

fusioninventory-agent_windows-i386_2.x.x-1.exe /S /debug /runnow /server=https://server1/glpi/plugins/fusioninventory/

this mean that i want to install fusioninventory in silent mode, run an inventory after installation, and send the inventory by https

fusioninventory-agent_windows-i386_2.x.x-1.exe /S /debug /runnow /server=http://server1/glpi/plugins/fusioninventory/

The same as above but with a plain http connection

And installation directory of the agent can be changed via command-line as below:

fusioninventory-agent_windows-i386_2.x.x-1.exe /S "/installdir=C:\Program Files\FusInv"
Edit
Upgrade with FusionInventory Deploy

If you upgrade the agent with FusionInventory Deploy and the agent is launched with a Service, you will need an agent > 2.2.0-2 and the /execmode=none parameter. This way, the agent won't remove or add service or update the Tasks Scheduler setting. So you will keep the previous settings.
