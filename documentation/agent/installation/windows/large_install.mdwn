## fusioninventory.vbs

[[fusioninventory.vbs|documentation/agent/installation/windows/fusioninventory.vbs]] is a VBS script used to:

* Download the fusioninventory Windows installer
* Remove OCS Inventory Agent
* Install or upgrade FusionInventory

To use this script, you must first download the script and then edit it. The first lines of the script
must be adjusted for your configuration:

    versionverification = "2.2.6-1"
    fusionarguments = "/S /server=http://server1/glpi/plugins/fusioninventory/ /rpc-trust-localhost /runnow"
    ' Depending on your needs, you can use either HTTP or Windows share
    'fusionsetupURL = "\\server1\data\fusioninventory-agent_windows-i386_" & versionverification & ".exe"
    fusionsetupURL = "http://prebuilt.fusioninventory.org/stable/windows-i386/fusioninventory-agent_windows-i386_" & versionverification & ".exe"
    uninstallocsagent = "yes"

* versionverification: the version of fusioninventory to install
* fusionarguments: the command line argument for the [[Windows installer|documentation/agent/installation/windows]])
* fusionsetupURL: the location of the Windows installer binary (either HTTP or Windows share)
* uninstallocsagent: "yes" if OCS Agent has to be removed


You can use this  script to:

* run a silent installation on a given machine
* deploy the agent on your network using psexec
* prepare a GPO to deploy the agent on all the machines of the Windows domain
