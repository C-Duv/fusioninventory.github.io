# How to use the pre-built versions

There are also pre-compiled or pre-built versions of the agent maintained by the project. The idea is to launch the agent without installing anything on your system. Here are the steps : 

Download the prebuilt version for your OS <http://prebuilt.fusioninventory.org/stable/>:

* Uncompress the downloaded archive
* Configure the agent by editing the agent.cfg file
* Launch the agent with the following command as root : `./fusioninventory-agent`

The FusionInventory project recommands usage of packages (deb, rpm, etc.) when it's possble. Prebuilts are interesting for testing, or when you have no possibility to install packages on your system.
