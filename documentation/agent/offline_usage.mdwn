# Offline usage

## Offline agent execution 

Most tasks handled by the agent can be executed directly without server, when
it is not available, for instance. Or for easier troubleshooting.

Each task has a dedicated executable for this purpose. For instance, to execute
an inventory:

    $> fusioninventory-inventory

See [[man pages|man]] for details.

## Results imports

### FusionInventory for GLPI Interface

Go in *Plugins > FusionInventory > Import agent XML* Menu and upload the XML
file.

### fusioninventory-injector

The agent has a dedicated executable for result injection:

    $> fusioninventory-injector -v -f myfile.xml -u http://glpi083/plugins/fusioninventory/

See [[fusioninventory-injector man page|man/fusioninventory-injector]] for
details.

## curl

You can also use curl to push an inventory. This can be useful if your perl
installation has no SSL support, for instance:

    curl --header "Content-Type: Application/x-compress" --cacert your-ca.pem -u username:password --data @/tmp/lazer.local-2011-10-04-12-21-23.ocs https://glpi/plugins/fusioninventory/

With no SSL check and no authentification :

    curl --header "Content-Type: Application/x-compress" -k --data @/tmp/monposte.local-2012-10-04-12-21-23.ocs https://myglpiserver/plugins/fusioninventory/
