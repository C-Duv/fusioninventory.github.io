msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"_managed mode_: the agent runs continuously in the background, wakes up "
"periodically to execute the tasks required by the server, and may eventually "
"executes out of schedule on server request."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"_half-managed mode_: the agent executes immediatly the tasks required by the "
"server, and stops. This can be automated through an external scheduling "
"mechanism (cron, task scheduler)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '* '
msgid ""
"_autonomous mode_: the agent executes immediatly a specific task, and "
"stops.  The results are then sent to the server, or kept for delayed upload. "
"This can be automated through an external scheduling mechanism (cron, task "
"scheduler)."

msgid "Managed mode"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"This mode requires the agent to be run as a server process (daemon under "
"Unix, service under Windows), meaning the perl interpreter is permanently "
"loaded in memory, which may not be convenient for small systems. "
"Additionaly, a network port is opened on the system with a process running "
"with full system privileges attached to it."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The agent wake-up schedule is controlled from GLPI server, using PROLOG_FREQ "
"setting. More precisely, the agent wakes up at a random time between 50% and "
"100% of this value, ie for 24H, it will executes sometimes between 12 and "
"24H.  Additionaly, the server may also initiate additional out-of-schedule "
"executions by sending HTTP requests to the agent."

msgid "Half-managed mode"
msgstr ""

"This mode requires an external scheduling process to run the agent (cron, "
"task scheduler, trainee, ...) periodically. There is no impact on memory and "
"security between agent executions. The server still retains control over "
"what the agent executes exactly, however, as the agent will ask it for every "
"available module."
