#Agent configuration

The agent reads the configuration from a list of key / value. Sometime, value can be a list of value, in such case, a comma is used a field separator (e.g: server).

## Where is the configuration?

Depending on the OperatingSystem and the installation method, the agent will read its configuration from different places:

* /etc/fusioninventory/agent.cfg: default
* /opt/fusioninventory/agent.cfg: MacOSx mpkg
* /usr/local/etc/fusioninventory/agent.cfg: FreeBSD port
* /usr/local/etc/fusioninventory/agent.cfg: FreeBSD port
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\FusionInventory-Agent: Windows
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\FusionInventory-Agent: Windows 64 bits

## Minimal configuration

* server: the URL to the server, in general, it's http://glpiserver/plugins/fusioninventory/
* debug: debug can be 0, 1 or 2. We suggest to use 2 to help you understand what append
* httpd-trust: it's always a good idea to configure this key with the **IP address** (not the hostname) of the server. This way you will be able to use the **push** mode later.

Once this is done, you can [[force an inventory|documentation/agent/launch_the_agent]].

## Advanced configuration

All the keys are documented in the OPTIONS section of fusioninventory-agent reference documentation:

* [[2.1.x (old stable)|documentation/references/agent/2.1.x/fusioninventory-agent]]
* [[2.2.x (stable)|documentation/references/agent/2.2.x/fusioninventory-agent]]
* [[2.3.x (dev)|documentation/references/agent/2.3.x/fusioninventory-agent]]
