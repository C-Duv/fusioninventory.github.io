#Agent configuration

The agent reads its configuration from a configuration file (from the registry
on Windows), then from the command line. Most parameters can be set from any
method. For instance, the `server` parameter in configuration file is the same
as the `--server` parameter on command line.

Most configuration parameters are single-valued. Multi-valued ones use a comma
field separator. For instance, `logger = Stderr, File`

## Where is the configuration?

Depending on the OperatingSystem and the installation method, the agent will read its configuration from different places:

* `/etc/fusioninventory/agent.cfg`: default
* `/opt/fusioninventory/agent.cfg`: MacOSx mpkg
* `/usr/local/etc/fusioninventory/agent.cfg`: FreeBSD port
* `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\FusionInventory-Agent`: Windows
* `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\FusionInventory-Agent`: Windows 64 bits

## Minimal configuration

The only minimal requirement is an execution target, which can be either:

* `server`: a server URL, such as http://glpiserver/plugins/fusioninventory/
* `local`: a output directory, such /tmp/inventory

## Additional configuration

If you intend to run the agent in background, you'd rather set the additional
parameters:

* `debug`: 0, 1 or 2, to keep trace of agent execution

Once this is done, you can [[force an inventory|documentation/agent/launch_the_agent]].

## Advanced configuration

All the keys are documented in the OPTIONS section of fusioninventory-agent reference documentation:

* [[2.3.x (stable)|documentation/agent/installation/windows/windows-installer-2.3.x-command-line]]
* [[2.4.x (dev)|documentation/dev/]]
