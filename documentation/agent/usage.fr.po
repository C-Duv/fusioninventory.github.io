"In the first case, the agent execution scheduling is controlled from local "
"system, and the memory footprint between agent executions is zero."

msgid ""
"In second case, the agent execution scheduling is controlled from GLPI "
"server, as the agent runs regulary according to a parameter initially set in "
"its configuration (delaytime), overrided by the server at the first "
"connection (PROLOG_FREQ). Additionaly, the server may also initiate "
"additional out-of-schedule executions by sending HTTP requests if the web "
"interface is used. However, it also mean you have a full perl interpreter "
"loaded in memory constantly, and a network port open on your system with a "
"process running with full system privileges attached to it."

"If you don't need to control agent execution from the server, and if you're "
"able to periodically launch the agent without resorting to its internal "
"scheduler, through cron on Unix systems, or scheduled tasks on Windows, "
"you'd better use first execution mode. The various installation procedure "
"may offer limited choice about initial configuration, but you should always "
"be able to change it thereafter."

"When executing, the agent tries to run every available task for every "
"configured target. A task is a specific kind of work to perform (local "
"inventory, network discovery, wake on lan, etc...), while a target is both a "
"recipient for the result and a controller for this work (an OCS server, a "
"GLPI server, a local directory, etc...). Only the local inventory task is "
"compatible with all kind of target, tough, all others require a GLPI server "
"target, and will get discarded for other kind of target."
