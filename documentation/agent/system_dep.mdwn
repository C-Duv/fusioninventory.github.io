# System specific dependencies

On Solaris/SPARC, you must install sneep and record the Serial Number with it.

On Windows, we use an additional dmidecode binary shipped in the windows
distribution to retrieve many informations not available otherwise, including
fine-grained multi-cores CPUs identification. Unfortunatly, this binary is not
reliable enough to be used on Windows 2003, leading to less precise
inventories.

On any system, the privilege level used to run the agent will change inventory
results. Generally speaking, this means less results when run with lesser
privileges. On Windows, tough, running agent with SYSTEM privileges, which is
implicit if running as a service, does sometimes gives less results, especially
for shared printers only visible from a user account.

On Linux, lspci will be used to collect PCI, AGP, PCI-X, ... informations.
