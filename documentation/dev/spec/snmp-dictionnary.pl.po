"The agent stores a local copy of this dictionnary, and compares its md5sum "
"value with the one given by the server in its discovery request. When they "
"differs, the agent aborts the execution of the current task, with an error "
"status, and notify the server using a DICO element in its reply."

"The next time the server send an inventory request to this agent, it "
"automatically send an updated version of the dictionnary, as a giant string "
"embedded in its discovery request, and the agent caches it locally."

"Problems: - the current dictionnary update requires two agent execution, "
"server-side context, and is counter-intuitive for the user, whereas the "
"server could immediatly send the updated dictionnary to the agent "
"(http://forge.fusioninventory.org/issues/1034)  - the server doesn't allow "
"dictionnary retrieval outside of a scheduled inventory task, making usage of "
"alternative tools difficult (http://forge.fusioninventory.org/issues/1992)  "
"- the double XML-in-XML encoding is unelegant, whereas the dictionnary could "
"be sent either as an XML fragment, or as a separate download"
