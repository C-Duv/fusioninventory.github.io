# Development roadmap

## short term

Ensure the current agent version (2.3.x) works correctly with the GLPI plugin 0.85+1.0 (ie fix bug #2852)

## medium term

Ensure the next agent major version (2.4.x) is able to get rid of legacy prolog dialog with GLPI plugin 0.85+1.x, while still working with previous GLPI plugin release (including 0.85+1.0)

### agent behaviour

In order to establish the list of scheduled tasks, the agent should:
- issue a getConfig request
- decide if server answer is self-sufficient
- if not, complete it with an additional prolog request

### server-side getConfig answer enhancement

The server answer for getConfig request:
- should contains all scheduled tasks, not just ESX and Deploy tasks as it does
  with current release (0.85+1.0)
- should contains something to make it identifable by the agent as
  self-sufficient, such as a version number
- should not contain useless references to non-scheduled tasks (ie bug #2860)

### additional task-specific getJob answer specification

getJobs answer format for modules not using it should be specified:
- inventory (including specific options, ie bug #2847)
- netinventory
- netdiscovery
- wakeonlan

### long term

Ensure the agent uses JSON and REST API exclusively, both for tasks scheduling
and for task results submission.
