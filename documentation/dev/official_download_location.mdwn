# Where should we publish new files

** This document is for FI developers **

Please use the [[Get|get]] page to download new release.

Today different places are used to publish files. This situation
is confusing. This document present what should be done in the
futur.

## Today

* prebuilt.f.o
* CPAN
* different projects on the forge
* SF.net

The problems :

* Stable release can be download from various location, this is confusing.
* Development and package snapshot are publish at the same place.

## Draft

We can use download.f.o or the forge.
