# Where should we publish new files

** This document is for FI developers **

Please use the [[Get|get]] page to download new release.

Today different places are used to publish files. This situation
is confusing. This document present what should be done in the
futur.

## Today

* prebuilt.f.o
* CPAN
* different projects on the forge
* SF.net
* debian.f.o

The problems :

* Stable release can be download from various location, this is confusing.
* Development and package snapshot are publish at the same place.

## Draft

We can use download.f.o or the forge.

### download.f.o

* pros
** simple to manage
* cons
** no downlaod counters (so far)
** yet another anonical download localisation

### Forge.f.o

* pros
** already partially in use
* cons
** complexe to use with different packages IMO (Gon√©ri)
