Fusioninventory Plugin for GLPI - Tasks Redux

[[!toc levels=4]]

# Tasks redux

* Move tasks summary GUI into an appropriate tab/screen called Reporting (like using native GLPI reporting facilities or mReporting optional plugin)
* Rework task summary categories and layout (TODO: we welcome any mockup and propositions)
* Add history log on tasks


## Tasks GUI


* Externalize taskjobs reports in an independant page and base the display of this page on what have been done with the Deploy reports status

[[!template  id=info text="""
**TODO**

Add some mockup within this page or linked to another page if there are too many elements that makes this page unreadable.

* Split tasks from jobs to simplify the process
    * Create a Jobs management tab outside the tasks
    * We should be able to create Jobs in task management screen (cf. Package interface)
    * Tasks are only considered as crontab-like tasks.
    * Display the jobs list line by line.
    * Create some helper class which helps to list jobs associated to some
    task. For each Jobs linked, we must have:
        * some timeout (or delay) before running a job.
        * regroup every job by starting time.

* Jobstates are generated according to their delay and in the resultant order :

        example:
            * Wakeonlan 1 - no delay
            * Deploy 1    - no delay
            * Deploy 2    - 2 hours

        results:
            * at t+0, [Wakeonlan 1] and [Deploy 1] tasks are generated and ready to be executed by the agents.
            * at t+1h, nothing to be done
            * at t+2h, [Deploy 2] is generated and ready to be executed by the agents.

[[!template  id=info text="""
**TODO**

* Explain in detail the delay time. Maybe we can use some sort of maximum
duration in addition to the delay a task in order to limit usage on certain time slots.

## Tasks monitoring

* Enhance summary view with tasks related status informations like number of
discovered/inventoried devices (cf. NetDiscovery or NetInventory status) or the
number of packages deployed grouped by statuses. It looks like tasks summary
view in 0.84+1.0 but with relevant summarized details. Those details can be
refreshed dynamically on this consultation page. Each line must use the following format :

        <task icon> - <task name> - <specific global tasks details> - [global completion percentage] - <status icon>
            + more specific task details

* Example :

        <DEPLOY icon> - Office Apps install - 80 deployments (ok: 50, ko : 12, unneeded : 3) - completion : 81 % - <RUNNING icon>
            + Total targetted devices : 40
            + LibreOffice - ok : 30, ko :  2,  unneeded : 3
            + Thunderbird - ok : 20, ko : 10,  unneeded : 0

        <NETDISCOVERY icon> - Building 42 - discoveries : (50 new devices , 100 updated devices) - completion : N/A - <FINISHED icon>
            + networking devices : (10 new devices, 5 updated devices)
            + printers           : (30 new devices, 5 updated devices)
            + unknown devices    : (10 new devices, 90 updated devices)

        <NETINVENTORY icon> - Building 666 - targetted devices : 0 - 0 % - <INERROR icon>
            + Total targets : 0
            + IP range :
                9th circle, 8th circle, 7th circle
            + Error :
                no devices found to be inventoried

* Selecting a task will switch to a more detailed view with advanced logs (jobstates filtered by the currently selected task id)
