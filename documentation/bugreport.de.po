"In order for the developers to track and fix issues properly, you need to "
"use the [forge](http://forge.fusioninventory.org) bug tracker, and report an "
"issue with the proper component. This requires an user account."

"Here are a few usage rules, so as to avoid wasting efforts both for the "

#. type: Plain text

"You have to identify if the problems occurs on agent (the agent doesn't "
"report the expected value) or on server side (the server doesn't display the "
"expected value)."

"In order to do this, you have to look at the raw content generated by the "
"agent, and transmitted to the server. The easiest way is to enable *extra-"
"debug* in the GLPI plugin configuration, which will add an additional *XML* "
"tab to each GLPI object (computer, network device, etc...). Another solution "
"is to use the various *fusioninventory-something* executables (see "
"[[executable man pages|documentation/references]] for details)  to produce "
"the same content directly on the agent host. However, subtile differences "
"may occurs, if the execution environment and privileges are not the same as "
"non-interactive executions."

"You have to describe your problem clearly and precisely, for someone without "
