FusionInventory for GLPI installation

To install it, you must do:

Download archive here: http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-for-glpi/files

Uncompress the archive into the plugin folder of GLPI. File list seems to be like :

-- glpi

--- plugins

-----fusioninventory

-------index.php

------- hook.php

------- front

------- inc

etc...

* Connect on GLPI
* Go in the menu _Setup_ > _Plugins_
* Install FusionInventory
* Activate FusionInventory 

These operations will create tables in database MySQL and rights on the plugin.
Do the same for all fus* plugins
