## Installation

[[!template  id=warning text="If a previous FusionInventory version is already installed, you must read the Update section."]]

It's also always a good idea to do a backup of your database.

* Uncompress the archive into the plugin folder of GLPI. File list seems to be like :

    - D glpi
      - D plugins
         - D fusioninventory
            - F index.php
            - F hook.php
            - D front
            - D inc
            - â€¦

* Connect to _GLPI_
* Go in the menu _Setup_ > _Plugins_
* Install the plugins
* Activate FusionInventory 

These operations will create or upgrade the database and set the correct rights on the plugin.
Do the same for all fus* plugins

Once these is done, you can [[install your first agent|documentation/agent/installation]].
