# Introduction

To get complete inventory of switch and network printer by SNMP, we use SNMP models.
A SNMP model is a mapping between the OID and fields we need into GLPI.

NOTE: The tool is available only in version of plugins FusionInventory for GLPI 0.83+2.0 (not yet released)

# How it works

The tool have 2 parts:

* Client part: it's in the plugin FusionInventory for GLPI
* Server part: in one of our server

This is a short description of the steps for create de model

* Client authenticate on the server
* User add sysdescr of the device into GLPI and send it to server
* Server say if yet exist or not
* User upload the snmpwalk file into his own GLPI
* Server get all OID available in server
* User check OID mapping and send to server
* Server receive OID mapping, update the database and create models
* User can get models
