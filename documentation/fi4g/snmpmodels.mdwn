# Introduction

To get complete inventory of network switches and network printers by SNMP, we use SNMP models.
A SNMP model is a mapping from an OID to a field we need into GLPI.

[[!template  id=warning text="The tool is available only in developer version of FusionInventory for GLPI (0.83+2.0)."]]

# How it works

The tool have 2 parts:

* Client part: it's in the plugin FusionInventory for GLPI
* Server part: in one of our server

This is a short description of the steps for create de model

1. Client authenticate on the server
1. User add sysdescr of the device into GLPI and send it to server
1. Server say if yet exist or not
1. User upload the snmpwalk file into his own GLPI
1. Server get all OID available in server
1. User check OID mapping and send to server
1. Server receive OID mapping, update the database and create models
1. User can get models

# Preparation

You need 2 things for using this tool:

* Have an account on server, for this, send mail to d.durieux@siprossii.com with object 'SNMP TOOL ACCOUNT'
* Open your firewall for IP 93.93.45.69 and the port 9000 (TCP)

# Add account info in plugin

To add an account: 

1. You get account information we send to you by email
1. Go in menu __Administration__ > __Users__ 
1. Go in your user form
1. in tab _SNMP model tool account_, put login name, password and the key

# Access Tool

You can access SNMP tool menu by go to __Plugins__ > __FusionInventory__ > __SNMP__ > __SNMP models creation__

# Create SNMP model

Create a SNMP model mean manage OID mapping for your device.

## Search for a sysdescr

1. Go in menu _Check a sysdescr_
1. Define the itemtype : if it's a printer, network equipment (switch, routers)
1. Put the sysdescr of your device
1. Submit

## upload snmpwalk file

If the device with this sysdescr exist on the server, you can go to the next section _Device information_

Once you have submit sysdescr, a form appear with possibility to upload a snmpwalk file. The command to generate this file is writer in the interface. In thi case, you will go directly in section _Edit OID_
