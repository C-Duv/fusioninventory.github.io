# Introduction

To get complete inventory of switches, printers and other devices over the network, we use SNMP models.
An SNMP model is an XML file that will match an OID to a field in a GLPI network device object.

[[!graph  src="""

    style=filled;
    color=lightgrey;
    node [shape=box, color=purple];
    size = "5, 5";

        subgraph cluster_0 {
                style=filled;
                color=lightgrey;
                node [style=filled,color=white];
                "SNMP" -> "FusionInventory SNMP Model" -> "XML" 
                label = "FusionInventory Agent";
        }

        subgraph cluster_1 {
                style=filled;
                color=lightgrey;
                node [style=filled,color=white];
                "XML" -> "collector" 
                label = "FusionInventory for GLPI";
        }


    "device" -> "SNMP";

    "device" [ shape = "Mrecord" ];

The tool is available since FusionInventory for GLPI (0.83+2.0).

# How it works

The tool has 2 parts:

* Client part: Panel in the FusionInventory for GLPI plugin
* Server part: Maintained by the FusionInventory project

This is a short description of the steps for create de model

1. Client authenticates on the server
1. User adds sysdescr of the device into GLPI and sends it to server
1. Server checks and responds if it already exists
1. User uploads an SNMP walk file into his local GLPI
1. Server gets all OIDs available in server
1. User checks OID mapping and sends it to server
1. Server receives OID mapping, updates the database and creates new models
1. (All!) User can now get the new models

# Preparation

You need 2 things for using this tool:

* Have an account on SNMP model creation server, for this, send mail to d.durieux@siprossii.com with object 'SNMP TOOL ACCOUNT'
* Open your firewall for IP 93.93.45.69 (snmp.fusioninventory.org) and the port 80 (HTTP protocol, can transit by proxy without problems)

# Add SNMP submission account info in plugin

To add an account: 

1. You get account information we send to you by email
1. Go in menu __Administration__ > __Users__ 
1. Go in your user form
1. in tab _SNMP model tool account_, put login name, password and the key

# Access Tool

You can access SNMP tool menu by go to __Plugins__ > __FusionInventory__ > __SNMP__ > __SNMP models creation__

# Create SNMP model

Create a SNMP model mean manage OID mapping for your device.
You don't define the model directly, you define oid mapping for a device and after the server generate a model.

## Search for a sysdescr

[[!img screenshots/snmpmodels-sysdescr.png]]

1. Go in menu _Check a sysdescr_
1. Define the itemtype : if it's a printer, network equipment (switch, routers)
1. Put the sysdescr of your device
1. Submit

## Upload an SNMPwalk file

If the device with this __sysdescr__ exist on the server, you can go to the next section _Device information_

Once you have submit __sysdescr__, a form appear with possibility to upload an
snmpwalk file.  The command to generate this file is  in the interface.

[[!img screenshots/snmpmodels-upload_snmpwalk.png]]

In this case, you will go directly in section __Edit OID__


## Edit an SNMP model

[[!img screenshots/snmpmodels-construct_model.png]]

[[!template  id=warning text="""
Because SNMP Inventory update existing network devices with either a __serial
number__ or a __MAC address__ , you'll have to make sure that at least one of those OID are checked.
"""]]

[[!template  id=warning text="""
The percentage progress bar mean this oid is use for this mapping at xx% by all devices (and so by SNMP models). 

So if you have more than one oid for a mapping, see oids have the right value, if you have for example 2 oids with the right value, check the oid have the highest percentage.
"""]]

[[!template  id=warning text="""
Because FusionInventory Agent uses either **firmware** or **firmware1+firmware2**,
make sure to only check one of those combinations.
"""]]

### Color legend

Around each frame in a mapping name (comment, serial, firmware...), you can have 3 colors:

* green: it's the oid already used (in case you edit an existing device)
* blue: it's the oid suggested by the program
* red: it's the oid not suggested but in some case can be used


## Device information

# Get SNMP models and available for all

When you have an account, you have access to all models created on the server. For that, go in menu __Plugins__ > __FusionInventory__ > __SNMP__ > __SNMP models creation__ > __See All SNMP models__.

In this page, you can see:

* Models not imported (so new models since last release of plugin FusionInventory)
* Models to be updated (so modified models since last release of plugin FusionInventory)
* Models up to date 

You can check models you want to import and click, on bottom, on button import. The model is in your plugin FusionInventory and can used it now.

When we release the plugin FusionInventory for GLPI, we mark all these models as stable.
