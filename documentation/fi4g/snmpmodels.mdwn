# Introduction

To get complete inventory of switches, printers and other devices over the network, we use SNMP.

Despite standardization, information retrieved through this protocol differs
from device to device, so we have to use mappings between GLPI fields and SNMP
variable identifiers (OIDS). Those mappings are now coded in agent since version 2.3.4 ('SNMP models' are not used now). See this news for more information: <http://www.fusioninventory.org/news/2014/03/12/network_inventory_improvement/>

[[!graph  src="""
    style=filled;
    color=lightgrey;
    node [shape=box, color=purple];
    size = "5, 5";

        subgraph cluster_0 {
                style=filled;
                color=lightgrey;
                node [style=filled,color=white];
                "SNMP" -> "SNMP convert" -> "XML" 
                label = "FusionInventory Agent";
        }


     "device" -> "SNMP";
     "XML" -> "FusionInventory for GLPI" 

    "SNMP" [ shape = "Mrecord" ];
    "XML" [ shape = "Mrecord" ];
"""]]


Since FusionInventory for GLPI 0.84+2.2, we not need SNMP models (and in 0.85 version it's removed).

# Missing informations in SNMP inventory

If not all information are in the XML, created by the agent, send a snmpwalk and informations to walk@fusioninventory.org

# Install snmpwalk

## Debian

As the MIBs are not DFSG free, you will need to follow the instrutions from the debian wiki : [[!debwiki SNMP]].

For Debian 7 (wheezy) :

    # aptitude install snmp snmp-mibs-downloader

and comment out the line "mibs:" in /etc/snmp/snmp.conf.

## Ubuntu:

    # apt-get install snmp

## RHEL/CentOS/SL/Fedora:

    # yum install net-snmp-utils


# This is the command to create the snmlwalk file

    # snmpwalk -v [version] -Cc -On -t 30 -c [community] [yourip] .1 > file.log

For example:

    # snmpwalk -v 2c -Cc -On -t 30 -c public 192.168.0.10 .1 > file.log
