# Introduction

To get complete inventory of switches, printers and other devices over the network, we use SNMP models.
An SNMP model is an XML file that will match an OID to a field in a GLPI network device object.

[[!template  id=warning text="The tool is available only in developer version of FusionInventory for GLPI (0.83+2.0)."]]

# How it works

The tool has 2 parts:

* Client part: Panel in the FusionInventory for GLPI plugin
* Server part: Maintained by the FusionInventory project

This is a short description of the steps for create de model

1. Client authenticates on the server
1. User adds sysdescr of the device into GLPI and sends it to server
1. Server checks and responds if it already exists
1. User uploads an SNMP walk file into his local GLPI
1. Server gets all OIDs available in server
1. User checks OID mapping and sends it to server
1. Server receives OID mapping, updates the database and creates new models
1. (All!) User can now get the new models

# Preparation

You need 2 things for using this tool:

* Have an account on SNMP model creation server, for this, send mail to d.durieux@siprossii.com with object 'SNMP TOOL ACCOUNT'
* Open your firewall for IP 93.93.45.69 and the port 9000 (TCP)

# Add SNMP submission account info in plugin

To add an account: 

1. You get account information we send to you by email
1. Go in menu __Administration__ > __Users__ 
1. Go in your user form
1. in tab _SNMP model tool account_, put login name, password and the key

# Access Tool

You can access SNMP tool menu by go to __Plugins__ > __FusionInventory__ > __SNMP__ > __SNMP models creation__

# Create SNMP model

Create a SNMP model mean manage OID mapping for your device.

## Search for a sysdescr

1. Go in menu _Check a sysdescr_
1. Define the itemtype : if it's a printer, network equipment (switch, routers)
1. Put the sysdescr of your device
1. Submit

## upload snmpwalk file

If the device with this sysdescr exist on the server, you can go to the next section _Device information_

Once you have submit sysdescr, a form appear with possibility to upload a snmpwalk file. The command to generate this file is writer in the interface. In thi case, you will go directly in section _Edit OID_

## Device information


## Edit OID

WARNING: Because FusionInventory use **firmware** or **firmware1+firmware2**,
make sure to only add firmware one of those combinations.
