# A way to deal with inventories in DMZ

## Collect the inventories from DMZ agents

You can collect your DMZ inventories by using a limited script that get the POST
request of the agents.

An [[example is avalaible here|documentation/fi4g/dmz/collect.php]].

Then, you can configure agents in DMZ machines this way:
fusioninventory-agent --server http://server/collect.php
, where "server" is the name of the computer to which you copied the script (collect.php).

## Import results with fusioninventory-injector

Once the xml inventory files are written, you can move them outside of the DMZ and
finally import these files to GLPI using [[fusioninventory-injector|documentation/references]].
