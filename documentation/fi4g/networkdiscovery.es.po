"Any device replying to at least of those protocols will be *discovered*, "
"with just minimal information, such as mac address and hostname."

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Additionaly, if the device replies to SNMP, the agent will attempt to "
"identify it, using its system description (SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0) value. "
"Rule-based identification, using rules hardcoded in the agent, allows a "
"minimal level of identification. Dictionary-based identification, using a "
"server-provided database of known values, allows a more precise "
"identification. If any suceed, the device will be *identified*."

"Discovered devices are then reported to the GLPI servers, and import rules "
"are applied.  If the device type (printer, network device, etc...) has not "
"been set, the device will be considered as 'unknown devices'."

msgid "SNMP Credentials"

"There is now way to distinguish a failed SNMP authentication attempt from a "
