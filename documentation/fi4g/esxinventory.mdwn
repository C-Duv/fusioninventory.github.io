# Installation
To inventory ESX or Vcenter, there is no specific agent to be installed on the ESX. The Fusioninventory agent installed on Windows or Linux, will inventory remotely by a automatic task.
For Windows host, the Agent Fusioninventory provided the module. For Linux distribution, you must install a package.
On Redhat/Centos, run 

    # yum install perl-FusionInventory-Agent-Task-ESX

On Debian/Ubuntu :

    # apt-get install libfusioninventory-agent-task-esx-perl

# Task configuration in GLPI

Go to Plugins → Home → FusionInventory → Agents management
