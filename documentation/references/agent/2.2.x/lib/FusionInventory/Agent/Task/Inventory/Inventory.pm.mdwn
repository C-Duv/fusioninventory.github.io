# NAME

FusionInventory::Agent::Task::Inventory::Inventory - Inventory data structure

# DESCRIPTION

This is a data structure corresponding to an hardware and software inventory.

# METHODS

## new(%params)

The constructor. The following parameters are allowed, as keys of the
%params hash:

- _logger_

a logger object

- _statedir_

a path to a writable directory containing the last serialized inventory

- _tag_

an arbitrary label, used for server-side filtering

## getContent()

Get content attribute.

## mergeContent($content)

Merge content to the inventory.

## addEntry(%params)

Add a new entry to the inventory. The following parameters are allowed, as keys
of the %params hash:

- _section_

the entry section (mandatory)

- _entry_

the entry (mandatory)

- _noDuplicated_

ignore entry if already present

## setTag($tag)

Set inventory tag, an arbitrary label used for filtering on server side.

## setHardware()

Save global information regarding the machine.

## setOperatingSystem()

Operating System information.

## setBios()

Set BIOS informations.

## setAccessLog()

What is that for? :)

## computeChecksum()

Compute the inventory checksum. This information is used by the server to
know which parts of the inventory have changed since the last one.

## computeLegacyValues()

Compute the inventory global values, meaning values in hardware section such as
CPU number, speed and model, computed from other values, but needed for OCS
compatibility.

## saveLastState()

At the end of the process IF the inventory was saved
correctly, the last\_state is saved.
