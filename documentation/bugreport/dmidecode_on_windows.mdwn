# How to get dmidecode on Windows

We use dmidecode to get BIOS and system information on Windows like we do for other
operating system. This in order to get consistent output.

Time to time, we may request a dmidecode.exe output to complet a bug report:

First you need to open a `cmd.exe` console as Administrator. The process is to such
console has changed since Windows Vista and 7, please read ( <http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/11841-run-administrator.html>, <http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/run-a-command-as-administrator-from-the-windows-vista-run-box/> ).

Once the console is open, you must go in the _FusionIninventory-Agent-directory_\perl\bin directory and you can now run:

    dmidecode > output.txt

output.txt is the file to attach to your bug report.
