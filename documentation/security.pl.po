"First, the server automatically trust any received message, using the "
"identifier found in the message (unfortunatly called DEVICEID) to identify "
"the sending agent. If you want to protect your inventory from rogue reports, "
"you have to restrict access to the plugin location on your GLPI server, "
"typically using HTTP authentication. And preferentially over HTTPS, to "
"prevent password sniffing."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Second, some messages between the server and the agent may contain sensible "
"informations. For instance, NetInventory tasks involves sending SNMP "
"credentials from the server to the agent. In this case, HTTPS usage ensures "
"proper communication encryption."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Third, some tasks are explicitely designed to make the agent execute "
"arbitrary commands on its host. For instance, the Deploy task is used to "
"install software on agent side. In this case, HTTPS usage ensures proper "
"server authentication."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"If none of these issues is a concern for your particular case, for instance "
"because your network is trusted, you don't need the additional overhead and "
"complexity of HTTPS."

"HTTPS support on server side is enforced by the HTTP server, typically "
"Apache with mod_ssl."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"HTTPS support on agent side relies on LWP (also known as libwww-perl), the "
"standard Perl library for HTTP communication. This library is able to use "
"either Crypt::SSLeay or IO::Socket::SSL perl modules transparently for HTTPS "
"support. However, only the second one is able to perform server certificate "
"validation. As a consequence, the agent will refuse to use HTTPS, and exit "
"immediatly if IO::Socket::SSL is not available, unless certificate checking "
"has been explicitely disabled, through *no-ssl-check* [[configuration "
"parameter|agent/configuration]] (or alternatively, *--no-ssl-check* "
"[[command line option|agent/man]])."
