## Tasks are not enabled

    Task NetInventory is not enabled
    Task NetDiscovery is not enabled

These messages show up in the agent log when the server do not ask for an Network
Discovery or a Network Inventory.

## How to redirect OCS agent with Apache

You can use an [alias](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_alias.html) directive to
redirect traffic from /ocsinventory to FusionInventory.

    Alias /ocsinventory "/var/www/html/glpi/plugins/fusioninventory/front/communication.php"

Take care to declare this directive before an `Alias / XXX` or it will be ignored.

For example:

    Alias /ocsinventory "/var/www/html/glpi/plugins/fusioninventory/front/communication.php"
    Alias / /var/www/html/glpi/
    
    <Directory /var/www/html/glpi>
        Options None
        AllowOverride Limit Options FileInfo
    
        php_value memory_limit 256M
    
        Order Deny,Allow
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

It's also possible to use a regular expression for that.

## I get *Unable to find agent to run this job* message

You will get *Unable to find agent to run this job* message when the server can't find an agent
to run a task in push mode:

* Ensure an agent is running as service or daemon
* The server can contact http://$agentIP:62354 directly
* Check in http://glpi/plugins/fusioninventory/front/agent.php if the agent has *Network discovery*
  and *Network inventory (SNMP)* modules turned on
