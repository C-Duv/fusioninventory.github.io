## How to redirect OCS agent in FusionInventory

You can use an [alias](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_alias.html) directive to
redirect traffic from /ocsinventory to FusionInventory.

    Alias /ocsinventory "/var/www/html/glpi/plugins/fusioninventory/front/communication.php"

Take care to declare this directive before an `Alias / XXX` or it will be ignored.

It's also possible to use a regular expression for that.
