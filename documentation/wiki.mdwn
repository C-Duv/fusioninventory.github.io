# Directory structure

## documentation/

### documentation/references/

This directory includes 4 subdirectories:

* agent
* agent-task-network
* agent-task-esx
* agent-task-deploy

Each of them are related to a subproject with it's own release. After every,
the following files are extracted from the tarball:

* README
* fusioninventory-* scripts POD documentation

For example, FusionInventory-Agent-2.2.5 comes with:

* README → documentation/references/agent/2.2.5/README (converted to Markdown)
* fusioninvenventory-agent → documentation/references/agent/2.2.5/fusioninventory-agent (converted to Markdown)
* fusioninventortory-injector → documentation/references/agent/2.2.5/fusioninventory-injectory

A symlink is also created from documentation/references/agent/last to documentation/references/agent/2.2.5.
